The [Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium](https://tcmhcc.utsystem.edu/) (TCMHCC) was established in 2019 by the 86th Texas Legislature. Its goal is to use the knowledge and resources of higher education health institutions to tackle pressing mental health issues and enhance the mental health care system for children and adolescents in the state.

As the design lead on the project, I was responsible for creating the brand, developing a guideline, and a website for this new state initiative.

## Branding

One of the challenges in designing the TCMHCC brand was balancing the official appearance expected from a state-operated service while also distinguishing it from other state services that often rely on a standard logo featuring the state map and additional elements.

In their project brief, the executive committee requested visual depictions of Texas, mental health, and tele-health technologies.

I have also created a brand guideline that other designers within over 14 partner institutions have employed to produce diverse design materials.

## Website

With an agile approach towards the design of the website, I developed a simple static website when the initiative was launched. But soon after and with the growth of the initiative, we felt the need for a comprehensive UX research and redesign of the website using a content management system.

I designed and developed a custom Wordpress theme for the final website which is actively used by an average of 200 users per day to date.
