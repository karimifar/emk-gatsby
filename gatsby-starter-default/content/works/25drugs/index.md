<div class="work-intro">

The [Texas Child Mental Health Care Consortium](https://tcmhcc.utsystem.edu/) (TCMHCC) was established in 2019 by the 86th Texas Legislature. Its goal is to use the knowledge and resources of higher education health institutions to tackle pressing mental health issues and enhance the mental health care system for children and adolescents in the state.

As the design lead on the project, I was responsible for creating the brand, developing a guideline, and a website for this new state initiative.
