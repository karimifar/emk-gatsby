The [25 Drugs](https://utsystem.edu/25drugs/) is a microsite that features 25 dugs developed by one of the University of Texas Institutions. The goal of this project was to craft a very engaging index, enticing the audience with fun and interactive elements, and guiding them to detailed articles on each featured drug.

This project drew inspiration from the distinctive features typically found in publications such as The New York Times or The Washington Post. Wanted an engaging visual for each drug so we started by sketching illustrations for each story.

I was really interested in crafting highly interactive experiences for each story so I experimented with a physics engine called [Matter.JS](https://brm.io/matter-js/). I drafted some tests for a couple of the drugs but we soon recognized that achieving an interactive visualization for every drug was unfeasible given the limitations of our small team. However, I implemented the physics engine for the landing screen of the website, making a playful index for all of the stories.
